function [u,y] = ReadData(FileName,N,Nrep)

% Starting from a measurement with multiple repetitions, 
% this function combines all the measured input signals into a matrix u, 
% and all the measured output signals into another matrix y. 

% Example: [u,y] = Read('Output_Q1.mat',40)

% Input:
    % Filename: Name of the matfile containing the measurements
    % N: Number of samples in 1 repetition
    % Nrep: Number of repetitions
    
% Output:
    % u: NxNrep input matrix 
    % y: NxNrep output matrix
